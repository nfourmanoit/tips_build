The source distribution for the aXe simulation software aXeSIM
==============================================================

1. Introduction
---------------
This are the sources of the C-executables for the beta-distribution of
the aXeSIM package. You should try to compile from this package only
if you are not working with Linux or in case that you encountered
problems with the binaries that are delivered with the
aXeSIM package.
The programs used for aXeSIM are selection of the programs that
are part of the aXe software
(see http://stecf.org/software/slitless_software/axe),
thus structure and setup are very similar to aXe.


2. Requirements
---------------
The following are required to compile and install the aXeSIM
executables:

- GNU CC 2.95 or later compiler
- GNU Scientific Libraries 1.0 (http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/)
- WCStools 3.6 libraries (http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/software/wcstools/)
- CFITSIO 2.x libraries
(http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html)

Install the libraries according to the instructions given with the
respective source or binary distributions.

In case that you do not have the privileges to install the libraries
at their default location (e.g. "/usr/local/lib" or similar) it
may be wise to install them at a common location, e.g. under
"/yourpath/axelibs/", where "yourpath" is the location of a directory
accessible to you. In this case do not forget to:
a) set the location of the libraries on the library path LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   (e.g. by inserting the line
    "setenv  LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/yourpath/axelibs/lib"
    into your .cshrc);
b) make the GSL-script "gsl-config" accessible by either putting its
   location ("/yourpath/axelibs/bin") on your PATH-variable
   or defining the variable GSL_CONFIG by inserting the
   line "setenv GSL_CONFIG /yourpath/axelibs/bin/gsl-config"
   into your .cshrc.

3. Configuring aXeSIM
---------------------
The configure script generates a Makefile which can be used to compile
the aXeSIM tasks. After all the above preparation it should be
straightforward to configure aXeSIM. In the case that the libraries are
at the usual locations this is done by typing

>./configure

in the directory where the aXeSIM-source was extracted.

In the event that the libraries listed above are not installed in the
usual places, online parameters should be used to tell the configure
script where to find them. If you installed the libraries at the
locations recommended above, typing

>./configure --with-cfitsio-prefix=/yourpath/axelibs
--with-wcstools-prefix=/yourpath/axelibs/wcstools-3.x.x

should do the job. In case things do not go smoothly, follow the
instructions which go along with the error messages to fix problems.
Also the file "config.log" records continually the status information
of the configuration process. A detailed description of the errors
and possible solutions can be found there, too.

The configure script should create a proper Makefile on Linux, Solaris
and MacOSX platforms. Note that under MacOSX for Power PC's the option
"--build=powerpc" must be added to the options listed above,
and ``-build=i386-pc-macosx'' for Intel Macs.


4. Compiling aXeSIM
-------------------
The next step consists of actually building the aXeSIM library
and aXeSIM tasks:

>make

should create the following aXeSIM tasks:

./bin/aXe_AF2PET
./bin/aXe_DIRIMAGE
./bin/aXe_GOL2AF
./bin/aXe_PET2SPC
./bin/aXe_PETCONT
./bin/aXe_SEX2GOL
./bin/aXe_STAMPS
./bin/aXe_DISPIMAGE
